I'm pretty sure that the site redesign for Fauxcabulary.org is complete now. I'm mostly satisfied with the look and feel, for both desktop and mobile devices. I didn't get to add the search feature back in, but I've added many other features and eye candy. Notably, the [Gallery]({{ "/gallery" | relative_url }}) has been expanded greatly and the [Shop]({{ "/shop/" | relative_url }}) has all new items.

I'm moving on to other projects now, but the site has been written to support daily terms for the next four years or so. I'm sure I'll be adding more content in that time, so the window for non-repeating content will continue to grow. I also have plans to finish the conversion of [my 2016 scrabble AI](http://groundh0g.github.io/games.codetopia.com/wordplay/wordplay.html) to the new site using [more modern techs](https://games.joehall.net/wordswithjoe/).

Keep checking in, or follow me on the socials (@groundh0g on most major social media sites), to know when the new content is ready.
